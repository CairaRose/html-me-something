			<h2>I Want to Make Video Games to Help and Inspire People</h2>
			<p>That's pretty much always been what I've wanted to do, even if that goal was obfuscated and felt like it was out of my reach for a while. With the state of the world, it seems like such a silly goal sometimes,
and it seems entirely plausible I may never actually reach it, but I spent so long thinking it was something I would never do, and now that I believe I can I owe it to myself to try. As a kid and teenager, I was near-constantly overwhelmed
with a confusing mix of ADHD, anxiety, autism, and, as I wouldn't come to realize until much later, dysphoria. School was a nightmare, and <b>especially</b> towards the end of high school, teachers shamed me in front of everyone for being
unable to complete homework. I always tried my hardest to complete what I could but more often then not would come up massively short. Most nights as a teenager were spent self destructing alone in my dark bedroom. Through those times and
and up until today and hopefully through on until I die, video games have provided me with a place I can escape, a place where I can succeed and be the hero, and overcome the constant struggle for any amount of happiness. Sometimes, though
for a long time I would never choose to if I could help it, I even got to be a girl. I'll never forget starting my first Pokemon playthrough shortly after I realized I wasn't a boy. Just allowing myself to play as the female avatar was such
a powerful choice and important step in my journey to self-acceptance. Pokemon was a safe space where I could experiment with names and clothes, and always be gendered correctly and not care if my entire team was super girly. I cried so much
during my initial playthrough as girl. Pokemon is one of many games that have played important roles in my life and I've spent a lot of time studying them and the industry that makes them. It's been a life long hyperfocus and at this point, as
I am finally entering my career, my key takeaway is this-</p>

			<h2>Video Games are Awful</h2>
			<p>The video game industry, in particular here, the big titans like EA and Activision and Ubisoft that command economies larger than most small countries- are truly awful. It's kind of depressing when I hear
people talk about video games and all they know is stuff like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed and Madden. Games that are only concerned with extracting as much cash out of it's playerbase as it can for as long as it can. I'm not naive,
I know all businesses have to turn a profit- or at least that's what capitalism tells us- but the more I learn about how this industry operates, and how it has done so since it began- the more certain I am that it's not a place I would even want to
succeed. Time and time again, the industry's biggest players have been caught <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/crunch">forcing their developers into intense crunch periods</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-21/ubisoft-sexual-misconduct-scandal-harassment-sexism-and-abuse">
harboring and protecting known abusers and sexual predators.</a> That's not even to touch on what these companies do openly; mass layoffs upon project completion is industry standard, pushing literal gambling towards children (on their way to their true targets- people recovering from gambling addiction),
leaning into rightwing rhetoric and conspiracy theories, lavishly enriching their CEOs and other executives, and just, generally, kinda being the worst. Learning from such a young age about the injustices present in my
dream job helped teach me to find injustices everywhere, and I've come to find a lot of the industry's problems are really the problems of our society at large. So what am I supposed to do now? </p>

			<h2>The Real Super Power of Teamwork</h2>
			<p>As a kid, I was a regular visitor of Newgrounds, a website dedicated to free flash games and cartoons where creators could upload their content and be judged by the community. With the advent of online
marketplaces in the late 2000's, it became increasingly more plausible for smaller games to enjoy wide release on consoles. Soon enough many of the most talented indie artists working on flash games had a more realistic pathway towards
monetizing their games. Indie games have been around since forever, but it wasn't until the likes of Super Meat Boy, Braid, Bit.Trip, World of Goo and other early downloadable hits that they became even semi-viable as a career path. My
favorite indie games inspire me on a regular basis, more than anything else, and there's nothing like playing through a new one and slowly realizing how fast it's becoming one of my favorite games ever. I watch many of these developers
and small teams sometimes for years before they release a final product, and all their struggles, successes, failures and triumphs fill me with the determination I need to keep walking my own path. One of my biggest dreams is to work
together with a team of my own to create something that will reflect all of us and our hopes and dreams for a better world. I'm not good at talking to people or having friends but I've been meeting lots of lovely people lately and I'm
working hard every day to make those dreams come true.</p>

			<h3>Celeste</h3>
			<p>Celeste is my favorite game of all time. A deceptively simple, and fiercely clever platformer about a girl named Madeline trying to climb a mountain. Along the way, she encounters Granny- a rude old lady that casts doubt on her ability, Mr Oshiro - a ghostly hotel
owner in denial that his hotel closed long ago, Theo - a friendly photographer that is also climbing the mountain, and - all of her inner doubts, anxieties and fears manifested into a shadow-y doppelganger dubbed outside the game as 'Badeline'. Celeste ties every single part of itself
together to become a powerful experience about depression and anxiety. The music, art, gameplay and story all come together in a way that make it even greater than the sum of it's parts. The level design has been fine tuned to provide an appropriate difficulty curve that can be
customized to each player's preferences. Instead of a traditional Easy/Medium/Hard scale, Celeste has an assist mode that lets players specifically choose how they need help, and is completely non-judgmental towards players that do activate assist mode. Video games have a long
way to go in terms of becoming more accessible to more players, and including accessibility features like Celeste's will be a huge priority for me as a developer. Celeste's often rather punishing difficulty curve helps accent
the story and it's themes of never giving up or succumbing to your inner demons. To always keep climbing the mountain, no matter how difficult it gets. The game having accessibility options doesn't diminish any of that- it just makes it
more accessible to players who would struggle too much otherwise, and the fact they were able to make this game as accessible as it is, should be a lesson to the entire industry.<br>
<br>

	Another thing I love about Celeste is a complete lack of enemies. Sure, Granny is there making Madeline doubt herself and Madeline's doppleganger briefly sends the ghostly hotel owner into a fit of unctontrollable rage Madeline
has to make a quick escape from, but, you never 'kill' anything. There's no shuffling little henchman to murder by the truckload, the game's challenge comes entirely around navigating the level itself and making precise jumps and dashes.
Madeline never has a final showdown with her Badeline where the shes's defeated forever. After a long and intense chase sequence, Madeline treats Badeline with compassion and tells her that it's okay to be scared.
That it's okay to feel all of the things that she feels and that she's sorry she hasn't treated her better. And then the two agree to work together, represented in gameplay by Madeline gaining the ability to dash in the air a second
time, and the final level of the main story begins. The two work their way once more through every environment in the game and talk to eachother about their feelings throughout. When the pair finally reach the top of the mountain, they
sit there and watch the sunset together, finally at peace with the other. The credits show the pair working together to descend, before they meet Granny in her cabin, along with Mr. Oshiro and Theo, the group celebrates and the player is given their final
death and strawberry count.</p>

			<h3>Transistor</h3>
			<p>Video games are often male power fantasies. Bald grizzled space marines are a dime a dozen, and much of the gaming industry does it's best to remain as """apolitical""" as possible, which means upholding the
status quo which means... cishet white dudes can never feel too challenged or threatened by things such as too many minorities on screen at a time. Transistor is the kind of power fantasy I can actually get into. You play as Red, a singer in a futuristic society that is
quickly falling apart. You start the game after one of Red's concerts- there was an assassination attempt and Red's boyfriend jumped in they way to save her. Outside the venue, Red discovers her voice is gone and comes across a sword with her boyfriend's
voice- the titular Transistor. You learn of a shadowy organization that controls the world by trapping all of the world's most influential people in the Transistor, and the stage, though perpetually in shambles, is set. Very quickly you can infer that the game's world
itself is inside a program. Red earns various attacks through the game called functions and you can assign functions as attacks or you can use them as arguments to modify other functions. You'll need to level up and optimize your functions if you want to make it through
the legions of robots that are sent to stop Red.<br>
<br>

From the beautiful soundtrack highlighted by incredible vocals, to the melancholy narration provided by Red's boyfriend from the Transistor, the game sets a distinct and somber mood that is broken up by waves of robotic
enemies that keep the player feeling like they (and Red) are a total badass. You constantly feel yourself getting stronger, not just by leveling up, but by actively learning the game and cleverly optimizing your functions. You
(mostly) don't harm other living creatures at all, and trying to survive as the world falls apart due to the actions of a few rich assholes is exceedingly relateable. Sometimes a girl just needs to feel powerful and smart and capable
and I can think of few other games that are as good at providing that as Transistor.

			<h3>Undertale</h3>
			<p>Undertale is, in my opinion, a medium defining game. I think that everyone should get the chance to play through this game as unspoiled as possible, because my runthrough of Undertale remains to this day the
most powerful gaming experience I've ever had. To talk about this game at all is to spoil it, but talk about it I must, so... Undertale is a game about... spaghetti-loving skeletons, an awkward lesbian romance between a dinosaur and an
amphibian and the best heckin doggos you've ever seen. But it's also a game about player choice, and the relationship between a player and their avatar, and the choices they both make, sometimes as one, and sometimes as two different
entities. It's structured much like a traditional top down 2D RPG, but with a crucial twist. It is completely up to you whether your enemies live or die. Every boss fight and random encounter in the game, their fate is entirely up to the
player. Will you attack your enemies and earn EXP and become stronger? Or will you choose LOVE and befriend your enemies instead? You start the game as a child who's fallen into a forgotten world of monsters and is trying to find their way back the human
world, the same world that banished all these monsters eons ago. You're found by a incredibly kind goat lady named Toriel who gives you a tutorial of the game (get it? Tu'toriel'?), where you follow her back to her home. Once there,
she reiterates that the outside world is dangerous, and says that only the king himself could possibly get the child home. She wants the child to stay with her, where she can teach them, and keep them safe. Toriel is incredibly charming
and it's hard not to be endeared by this character by the time the game makes you fight her.<br>
<br>

She stands in front of the door in her basement that the player needs to go through to progress through the monster world. The game sometimes requires you to do unconventional things to spare certain enemies
and I didn't understand that quite yet. So I sorta by accident killed Toriel. Toriel gives you a phone earlier in the game and I found myself trying to call her throughout the entire thing, hoping I was confused and she didn't
really die and maybe at a point she'd pick up. She never did, and even as the rest of the game charmed me and had me in stitches and I fell in love with the rest of the cast, the game still had a sense of sadness throughout it.
Lonely moments where I'd try to call a character that couldn't call back.<br>
<br>

	But that's what New Game + is for, and Undertale uses it's to the highest potential. The game changes radically depending on your choices and who you
kill and this even extends across playthroughs. Certain characters will remember your actions and choices and respond accordingly. Not just the choices of the character, but the choices of the player themselves. The way this game
interacts with the player arguably makes it an ARG- augmented reality game- and because of these ARG aspects, I know I'm not alone when I say that I don't think I'll ever do another playthrough of Undertale again. If you get the
true pacifist ending, it becomes a betrayal to the games and the characters themselves to ever reset the save file. This game will make you laugh, cry, contemplate and by the end of it emotionally destroy you, and when it's all over and the last thing you want to do is
say goodbye to these characters, it asks you to put down the controller and never open the game ever again. Undertale is an incredible experience that could only ever work as a video game, and I think almost everyone that plays it will
walk away with a better understanding of what videogames can really be capable of, and the power that they hold as a uniquely interactive medium.</p>
